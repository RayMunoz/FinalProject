RISD: Web Projects Final Project

For my final project, I want to create a portfolio website for 3d models. Last semester I began making 3D models with Maya software, and I'd like a place to make a gallery of characters and objects I make.  The goal of my portfolio site would be to make interaction very animated. For example, if you click on an image of a certain character, a window could fade in while everything behind that window grays out. In this window, there would be additional pictures of that character that you could scroll side to side to view(similar to Itunes albums http://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/11/30/cc0b0e15-fdc4-11e2-8c7c-d4ae52e62bcc/resize/620x/28f5ca4ba361a9285c1e354c3f0456a9/Screen_Shot_2012-11-30_at_11.47.04_AM.png).

Also, within these windows I would like to implement an option to display the model in a 360 degree view similar to : http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/gorilla-silverback-fur-3-3d-model/553934
